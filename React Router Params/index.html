<p><strong>First:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click the Albums link below, then click on Album 1 and Album 2 to observe
    the behavior.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Code Challenges:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Add an album to the ALBUMSDATA array in the JS section. Hit the Run button,
    then click the Albums link and see how it's changed. This is a demo of how
    dynamic routing can work.
  </li>
  <li>
    Next, for the real challenge: You are invited to play around with the code
    and see what you can add - up to you. Some ideas: Add a component that
    displays albums by year, using a router parameter/match param for the year.
    Add a Random link that displays a random album. Display the album title
    along with "Album 1" and "Album 2". Add images and links to lyrics/MP3s...
    Up to you!
  </li>
</ol>
