<h3>Demo</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The code at the top of the JS panel of this Codepen demonstrates a way that <strong>Array.reduce()</strong> can be used to mimic the <strong>Array.map()</strong> method. 
  <li>This is not a particularly useful way to use <strong>Array.reduce()</strong>, since we have the ability to use <strong>Array.map()</strong> instead to accomplish the same end more easily. However, it demonstrates some of the flexibility and power of <strong>Array.reduce()</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenge 1</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pretend that there is no <strong>Array.filter()</strong> method. Use <strong>Array.reduce()</strong> to filter out only the objects from the provided array with a <span class='code'>price</span> property of <span class='code'>10</span> or over.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenge 2</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Write a <span class='code'>switch</span> statement for the provided reducer function such that when it is used to reduce the provided array of actions, it correctly produces a new <span class='code'>state</strong> with the actions applied to it.</li>
</ul>
