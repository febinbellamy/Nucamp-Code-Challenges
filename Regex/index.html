  <h1>What's a Regular Expression?</h1>
  <p>
    Once again, let's set aside React briefly to learn about a
    non-React-specific programming concept you will encounter in this week's
    coursework: <strong>regular expressions</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A regular expression, usually abbreviated as <strong>regex</strong> or
    <strong>regexp</strong>, is a special text string used to define a string
    search pattern in an efficient, powerful way. Regexes are supported in most
    programming languages, including Perl, Python, Java, Ruby, and yes,
    JavaScript. As long as you work with code, you're likely to encounter and/or
    use regexes, thus it is worth the time to get formally introduced to them
    now.
  </p>

  <h2>Regex Metacharacters</h2>
  <p>
    Regexes can be hard to read at first. They can resemble gibberish to the
    untrained eye. Here's an example:
  </p>

  <p><strong>^(\d{3})(\w+)$</strong></p>

  <p>
    Hold up - it's not as arcane as it may seem. You're probably familiar with
    the concept of wildcards, such as when you use <strong>*</strong> to stand
    in for "everything" -- e.g. the CSS * selector. Consider regexes as
    <em>wildcards gone wild</em> ... wild with specificity, that is. For
    example, you can use <strong>\d</strong> to match any digit from 0-9.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can tell JavaScript when you're using a regex by using two forward
    slashes, like so:
  </p>

  <p><strong>/</strong>^\d+$<strong>/</strong></p>

  <p>
    The pair of enclosing forward slashes tells JavaScript to look for a regex
    between them. The actual regex is the text between the forward slashes:
    <strong>^\d+$</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's unpack this. <strong>^</strong> matches the beginning of a string, and
    <strong>$</strong> matches the end. (These two are called anchors.)
    <strong>\d</strong> matches any single digit, and the
    <strong>+</strong> character means to repeat the preceding match 1 or more
    times. So <strong>^\d+$</strong> together means to match 1 or more digits,
    and nothing else (no letters or other non-numeric characters).
  </p>

  <p>
    These are known as regex special characters, or metacharacters. You can find
    a list here:
    <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions"
      target="_blank"
      >https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions</a
    >.
  </p>

  <h2>Testing a Regular Expression</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript gives you several tools for working with regexes, including the
    method .test(). Syntax:
    <em>regex</em>.<strong>test</strong>(<em>strToCheck</em>). For example, try
    entering these lines one by one into your Developer Console (use your
    browser's developer console rather than Codepen's for this one):
  </p>
  <p>
    const myReg = /^\d+$/;<br />
    myReg.test("hello"); <br />
    myReg.test(12345); <br />
    myReg.test("12345"); <br />
    myReg.test("abc3456");
  </p>
  <p>
    You should find that you get <em>true</em> for the two strings that contain
    only digits, regardless whether the data type is number or string, and
    <em>false</em> for the tests on strings that contain letters, because the
    regex is looking for strings that contain numbers only.

  <h1>Code Challenge</h1>
  <p>
    Finally, here is your challenge. In the JS section of this Codepen, write a
    regex test such that only a username that has alphanumeric characters (lower
    and upper case letters and numbers allowed only - no spaces, no
    underscores), has at minimum 2 characters, and has a number as the final
    character (such as 'Jason1') is accepted via the form below:
  </p>
  <p />

  <form>
    <input type="text" name="username" id="username" />
    <button type="button" onclick="validate()">Submit</button>
  </form>

  <p>
    HINT: Be sure to anchor the beginning of the string.<br />
    The test should pass for: jAsOn1, 23, 1JASON1<br />
    The test should fail for: jAsOn_1, 1, 1jason
  </p>

    Footnote 1: There are web tools that can help you with regexes. For example,
    search for 'regex parser' and you're sure to get many hits, such as this
    parser:
    <a href="http://xenon.stanford.edu/~xusch/regexp/" target="_blank"
      >http://xenon.stanford.edu/~xusch/regexp/</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Footnote 2: JavaScript has a special constructor to deal with regular
    expressions, named RegExp. The words <em>regex</em> and <em>regexp</em> are
    used more generally (non-language-specific) for the concept of regular
    expressions, and <em>RegExp</em> is a JavaScript-specific implementation.
    You do not need to be concerned about the difference at this time.
